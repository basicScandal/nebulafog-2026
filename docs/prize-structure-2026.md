## Stacking Rules

A single project CAN win multiple awards:

| Scenario | Total Prize |
|----------|-------------|
| SHADOW winner + SINGULARITY | $500 + $1,000 = $1,500 |
| ROGUE winner + CHAOS AGENT + Sponsor | $500 + $500 + $X |
| Solo hacker wins ZERO::PROOF + BEST SOLO | $500 + $250 = $750 |

**No limits on stacking** — if a project is that good, they deserve it.

---

## BUILD_NEW vs SHOWCASE

Both participation modes compete in the same award pools with weighted judging:

| Mode | Innovation Weight | Technical Depth Weight |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **BUILD_NEW** | Higher — what you accomplished in 8 hours matters |
| **SHOWCASE** | Higher — you've had time to polish, we expect it |

---

## Timeline (Day-of)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| During demos | People's Choice voting open |
| After demos | Judges deliberate |
| Closing ceremony | Awards announced in order: Recognition → Sponsor → Track → Cross-Track → SINGULARITY |

---

## Notes for 2026

- 2025 had ~24 projects demoing; plan for similar or slightly more
- Consider judge assignments to tracks for consistency
- Sponsor challenges announced in advance (pre-event) so teams can target them
- Mug design should be finalized by March 1
