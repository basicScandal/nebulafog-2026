**MISSION BRIEFING**

One day. One hundred operatives. $5,000+ in bounties. Everyone demos.

San Francisco's AI and security builders are converging—to learn from each other, form alliances, and stress-test the boundaries of what's possible. Build AI that defends or break AI to expose what the system missed.

No observers. No slide decks. Operators only.
